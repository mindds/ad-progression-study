# ad-progression-study
A single-nucleus transcriptomics study of 629,755 astrocytes from five brain regions of 32 donors representing the hierarchical spatiotemporal progression of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).

# cell type identification
The cell_type_identification.Rmd file has the scripts for integrating all the data from the 32 donors for the 5 brain regions (EC, ITG, PFC V1 and V2). The script also has further downstream analysis of clustering the cell types and identifying them through the markers genes.
